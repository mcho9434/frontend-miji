                &emsp; Right now, pickleball is all the craze. And many days at
                work, I'll work throughout the day, excited to play. After I
                take the 30 minute bus ride(remember this for later), put my
                shoes on, and get on the court for my first game, a couple
                things can happen:
            </div>
            <div className="text-lg ml-8">
                - I play well <br /> - I play poorly
            </div>
            <div className="text-lg">
                &emsp; Whatever quality I play at is between those outcomes. But
                until I get on the court, I have no idea where in the spectrum
                that day would be. After all, there's a trillion things that
                could impact the outcome. Do I need a new paddle? Am I sore from
                the previous day? Did I have a bad day at work?
            </div>
            <div className="text-lg">
                &emsp; And this is where the bus ride comes in. On that bus
                ride, as I wait to play, the state of the day is truly
                immaculate. Frankly, there's nothing to even spoil my notion of
                a "perfect" session. The pickleball for that day exists solely
                in my mind, with nothing to interrupt it. Of course, at the
                current moment, the moment I get on the court, this fragile
                fantasy shatters.
            </div>
            <div className="text-lg">
                &emsp; And there lies the key idea. There's a certain beauty in
                waiting for something. It exists as a intangible, incalculably
                pure concept. On the other side, there's a underlying danger
                of ignorance. As you speed down the highway to glory, you may miss the
                warning signs along the way.
            </div>
            <div className="text-lg">
                &emsp; For example, I'm slowly seeing this as I await founding a
                company in ~2/3 years. Initially, I saw the glamor of building a
                killer product and becoming wealthy. Now, I see everyday all the
                dangers and suffering involved. The original reasons for
                founding are still valid, but interesting to see how waiting has
                beautified my process.
            </div>
