    body: "I went back to Beacons for my summer internship. I heavily leveraged the reputation and trust from my previous internship to work on significantly higher trust tasks. I also took the opportunity to switch teams, gaining a wider breadth of experience and expanding my network. High-significance tasks included things like rewriting the user suspension infrastructure, implementing a new end-to-end email notification system, and contributing to the first company-wide component library. Being able to engage in discussions about these more complex tasks with the CTO or head of engineering was also a huge opportunity and learning moment. Here's a picture from when my sister visited the office. ",

I worked on the growth team, aiming to hit key indicators and target key growth factors. Beacons is great in that interns work the same way as full-times leading to hyper-fast learning. I’m thankful that I got to work in an intensive startup environment with great mentorship and complex engineering problems. Plus there was an office dog! That's Winnie :) ",

    body: "Otis is the world’s largest elevator and escalator manufacturer and servicer; I joined the compass360 team, working on interactive touchscreen terminals. I worked hard to modernize the outdated codebase, even pitching modern frameworks to engineering directors. I eventually rewrote the majority of the functionality into React, saving on payload size and load times. It was my first embedded software experience, so it was super cool to have hands-on experience! I’ve attached an image of the terminal I would interact with on a daily basis.",

My team and I pitched Cora, an emotionally intelligent toy for children to help regulate emotions. It was great to wear so many hats in a short time from developer to pitch-deck maker. At the end of the semester my team and I pitched to a panel of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Here’s a prototype of Cora(nervous) who was a combination of a dollar-store stuffed animal and an Arduino Uno!",
