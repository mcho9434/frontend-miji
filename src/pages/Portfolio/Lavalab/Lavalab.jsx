          &emsp;Lavalab is a student-run entrepreneurial incubator program that
          runs over the course of a semester from ideation to demo-day. My team
          and I pitched Cora, an emotionally intelligent toy for children to
          help regulate emotions. It was great to wear so many hats in a short
          time from developer to pitch-deck maker. At the end of the semester my
          team and I pitched to a panel of venture capitalists and
          entrepreneurs. Hereâ€™s some pictures of Cora(nervous) who was a
          combination of a dollar-store stuffed animal and an Arduino Uno!
