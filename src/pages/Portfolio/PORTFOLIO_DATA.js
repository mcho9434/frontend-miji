    body: "I returned to Beacons the summer of 2023. Having interned there in the past, I really wanted to have new experiences. I started off working on the email marketing product, then switched teams to the store product. Since I'd worked extensively with many members of the team, I got to work on many higher trust and risk tasks. I was also given tasks under my sole responsibility(DRI-Directly Responsible Individual). For example, I got to write the suspension system for the entire product complete with suspension audits, rule enforcement, and multiple frontend dashboards. I also added the first email notification system for the app and even contributed several new components to the Storybook library.",

    body: "Otis is the world’s largest elevator and escalator manufacturer and servicer; I joined the compass360 team, working on interactive touchscreen terminals. I worked hard to modernize the outdated codebase, even pitching modern frameworks to engineering directors. I eventually rewrote the majority of the functionality into React, saving on payload size and load times. It was my first embedded software experience, so it was super cool to have hands-on experience! I’ve attached an image of the terminal I would interact with on a daily basis.",

    body: "Lavalab is a student-run entrepreneurial incubator program that runs over the course of a semester from ideation to demo-day. My team and I pitched Cora, an emotionally intelligent toy for children to help regulate emotions. It was great to wear so many hats in a short time from developer to pitch-deck maker. At the end of the semester my team and I pitched to a panel of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Here’s some pictures of Cora(nervous) who was a combination of a dollar-store stuffed animal and an Arduino Uno!",
